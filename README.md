# customer-clustering

In this project, I learned about clusterings and machine learning algorithms as KMeans (Scikit-Learn).

It's was created following this YouTube tutorial by [Absent Data](https://www.youtube.com/@absentdata).

## Segment Shopping Customers
<b>Objective:</b> Understand the 'target customers' for the marketing team to plan a strategy.

<b>Context:</b> Your boss wants to identify the most important shopping groups (clusters) based on income, age and shopping score.

### Analysis

- Target group would be cluster 1 which has a high Spending Score and high Annual Income.

- ~54 percent of cluster 1 shoppers are women. We should create a marketing campaign targeting popular items in this cluster.
